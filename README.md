## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Less](https://lesscss.org/) - For styles
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)  - For development and building 


### What I learned
This is my third project in Frontend Mentor.
This time I used React and Vite for the development.
I realised why we need a framework to develop web frontend now.
Dividing a website into several components is an easy way to organise it and it make each component can be reused. We don't need to rewrite a whole page instead of fixing a small part of the corresponding component and don't worry about affecting the rest of the page.


### Continued development
Better organise my css by using frameworks like TailwindCSS or CSS Modules.  
Break down the role and function of each component.
